Name: Pinel

Backstory: Pinel is a halfling who grew up in a small village at the edge of a vast, ancient forest. From a young age, he was fascinated by magic and spent hours poring over books and practicing spells. Eventually, he became a powerful wizard and set out on a quest to explore the world and uncover its secrets.

Characteristics: Pinel is short and stocky, with a wild mass of curly brown hair and a thick beard. He speaks in a soft, gentle voice and often trails off mid-sentence as he becomes lost in thought. He wears a long robe adorned with intricate arcane symbols.

Behavior Characteristics: Pinel is quiet and contemplative, often lost in thought or absorbed in his studies. He is a gifted magician, but can sometimes become too caught up in his own research and lose sight of the bigger picture.
